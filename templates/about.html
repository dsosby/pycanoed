        This site serves really serves two purposes for me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Firstly, it's a learning tool. I'm a developer by trade that has been out of web development for
        a while and wanted to try out the latest technologies. This site was first written
        in Clojure, however my interest switched to Python. The site is currently written
        in Python using Flask and PyMongo. The source is available on my GitHub account as
        well...it may even prove useful to someone!
    </p>

        Secondly, it's a way to keep track of my canoe usage. After several weeks of <strike>begging</strike>
        negotiating with my wife, I was finally <strike>allowed</strike> encouraged to make
        the purchase. Part of the deal was that I had to use the canoe at least 20 times
        within the year or it had to go!
